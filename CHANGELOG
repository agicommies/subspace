[Unreleased]

Spec version: `115`

- Switching stake to global
- Removing the netuid from all stake based related operations and storages
- Changing subnet registration / deregistration logic out of stake based (TODO)

This whole local stake support gambiarra is getting deleted for grater good:
```rs
       let stakes = TotalStake::<T>::get();
                let total_yuma_stake = stakes; // PLACEHOLDER

                // FIXME:
                for (_netuid, founder_key) in Founder::<T>::iter().filter(|(n, _)| *n != 0) {
                    let Some(subnet_stake) = Some(0) else {
                        // Place holder
                        continue;
                    };

                    let yuma_stake_percentage = Percent::from_parts(
                        ((subnet_stake as u128 * 100) / (total_yuma_stake as u128)) as u8,
                    );

                    let founder_distribution = yuma_stake_percentage.mul_floor(to_distribute);
                    Pallet::<T>::add_balance_to_account(
                        &founder_key,
                        Pallet::<T>::u64_to_balance(founder_distribution).unwrap_or_default(),
                    );
                }
            }
```
